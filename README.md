<h4>Book Search Web Application</h4>

<p>Created with React and Vite, this web application allows users to search for books by their titles using the Open Library API. 
  It returns a list of five books that match the search query and provides the ability to add them to your TBR (To Be Read) list. 
  Once added to the Books on Deck section, books can be deleted or marked as read (struck through). </p>


<h4>Happy reading!</h4>
